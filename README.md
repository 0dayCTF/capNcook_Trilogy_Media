## Overview

capNcook is a Python Flask-based web application designed for dark web exploration. It utilizes Tor for anonymity and privacy, offering various features such as searching, retrieving response codes, TOR whois information, response headers, screenshots, and subdirectories of onion web-servers.

The tool employs efficient multi-threading in Python to enhance performance üöÄ 

## Features

1. **Search Over Tor:** Utilize different search engines on the dark web to find relevant onion domains.

2. **Anonymity and Privacy:** Identify entry and exit nodes to ensure anonymity and privacy when interacting with onion domains. The tool includes circuit rebuilding to maintain security.

3. **TOR Whois Information:** Retrieve WHOIS information for onion domains.

4. **Response Headers:** Capture response headers of onion domains.

5. **Screenshots:** Capture screenshots of onion websites.

6. **Subdirectories:** Identify and list subdirectories of onion web-servers.

## Screenshots

- This is the main interface of tool, select your preferred search engine and you can search using keywords like you'd do over any normal search engine and it'll list domains related to the keyword.

- In `onion_check`, it'll grab the site's title and description, its status code, and based on the status code it'll filter it as active / inactive.

- In headers, it's taking screenshots and grabbing server response headers, often reveals the technology or programming language used to build the web application via header like `X-Powered-By`, It may include information about the underlying frameworks or CMS (Content Management System) being used. The `Server` header typically indicates the software and version running on the server.
