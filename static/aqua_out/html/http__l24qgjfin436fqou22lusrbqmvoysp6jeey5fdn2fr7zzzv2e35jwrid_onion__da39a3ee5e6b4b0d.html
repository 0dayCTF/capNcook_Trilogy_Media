    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This not your typical site, with advice like "pick a good distribution key".  This is low-level, detailed, comprehensive research.  If you do any kind of serious work with Redshift, the content here will blow you away.</p>

    <p>The core content are the white papers, but there are a growing number of Redshift tracking/monitoring pages.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Max Ganz II.  I began using Redshift the very day it went to GA - I was the engineer in a Stateside three-man startup, and we were trying to get into the Redshift beta programme when GA happened.  I then used Redshift intensively (think 80 hour weeks) for a year and a half, and ended up having a monthly one-to-one meeting with one of the Redshift team managers, and one or two features in Redshift today come from those meetings, such as the ALL distribution style.</p>

    <p>Before this, I was (and still am) a C programmer; working with all the fundamentals of computing, a kernel developer, and with a particular interest in data structures, which led me to databases, and I wrote my own relational database, in C, from scratch, where the combined understanding of computing fundamentals and databases put me in the ideal position to move into data engineering.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward to about seven years ago and I picked up the Redshift thread once more, with some contract work, and then with a view to writing a book, which came in the end to be this web-site, and the research and monitoring published here, and <a href="/combobulator/index.html">Combobulator</a>, a browser-based PII and regulatory safe Redshift management application, distributed as an AMI, and providing <a href="/consultancy/amazon-redshift-consultant.html">consultancy</a> services.</p>
